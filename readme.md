Hello! I'm a French Python developer. My goal is to bring ideas to life and simplify every aspect of development. My current project is [Dispy](https://github.com/JamesMinoucha/Dispy), and Iâ€™m also working on learning C++.

My values are simplicity, transparency, and open-source.

In the future, I would really like to build my own team of developers and designers to create even bigger projects!
